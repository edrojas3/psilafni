# **PRIME-DE preprocessing with AFNI**

![](https://github.com/edrojas3/psilafni/blob/main/media/monkey3.png?raw=true)

### Description:

- Preprocessing is a key aspect in MRI analyses. There is not gold standard to achive a "good" preprocessing of MRI data, neither humans, macaques or any other species.
- Each PRIME-DE site collected macaque fMRI in a different way (e.g Field of View, voxel resolution etc.).
- between-site discrepancies in data acquisition result in the need of creating customized and flexible AFNI scripts to address different issues in the data that vary from site to site.

- **We are trying to generate a customized AFNI preprocessing recipe for each PRIME-DE site (or in some cases per individual) to end up with the best posible  quality.**
